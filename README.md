#Nutrak

1) Setup instructions:
Open Xcodeproj and click on run. Cocopods haven't been used and no need to install any dependency.

2) Libraries used and why.
No external libraries have been used. Functionalities such as charts, carousel, and camera are custom made.

3) Notes or assumptions:
It is assumed that the application is in portrait only mode and doesn't require landscape mode. Also, I have implemented some other screens and made sure the navigation works properly. I have tried to create an application which can be considered equivalent to a prototype.
- Built using XCode 16.2
- Testing device: iPhone 15 Pro Max (iOS 18.4.1)
- Also verified on iPad 11 inch and iPhone SE simulators

5) How I approached the task and handled challenges:
I used SwiftUI and followed the MVVM architecture to maintain a clear separation between views, business logic, and data. I ensured a clean code structure by organizing the project into folders such as Utilities, Flows, and Core elements, making the codebase modular and scalable.

During implementation, I focused on creating reusable views and maintaining consistency in design by using shared styles and colors. One of the challenges was ensuring UI responsiveness across different screen sizes. I addressed this by testing on various simulators and devices, using SwiftUI’s flexible layout system, and adjusting spacings dynamically.

Additionally, I took care to implement best practices around state management and ensured all UI elements responded correctly to user interaction and state changes. This structured and modular approach helped me deliver a stable and maintainable solution.
